  Splitting Gully Foyle's Cyberclub CSVs 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the most important (and biggest) collections is the Cyberclub collection
mirroring Playboy's Cyberclub server and featuring pics of every Playmate EVER,
every centerfold and evey magazine cover. There is an excellent CSV maintained by my
friend Gully Foyle, aka Bill. This CSV is close below 10000 pics (as you read
this probably above), so he has split it by decades and years. There are also
different naming schemes (stupid original and sensible new names). All these CSV
did Gully maintain by hand, until I wrote a tool named FSPLIT for him to do this
automatically. Fsplit was not Y2K compatible however, and I lost the source in a
mishap some time ago so I made FSPLIT a scansort feature. If you want only FSPLIT
you can easily use ScanSort simply for this without knowing beans about the other
features (but maybe you get interested... :-) .

Switches are

scansort -F	give online help

-Fd	split by decade
-Fy     split by year
-Fc     split by category (L-Port, L-Head, Cover, Big Centerfold, Chippy-Data
-Fcd    split by category and L-Port by decade
-Fo     create L-Port CSV with original names
-Fod     " , split by decade

You can also create just one big E-CSV. So you have ONE collection and STILL
everything nicely sorted into subdirectories - the BEST way to use it imho.
-Fe     create a E-CSV (\decade\year)
-Fed    create a E-CSV (\decade)
-Fey    create a E-CSV (\year)

Scansort searches the current directory for files named Foyle_PCC_xxxx_*.csv and splits
the one with the highest number it finds. If you want to give the name yourself use

-FnCSV_NAME   define CSV to split (default: find automatically)


If you have just completed the CC collection and burned it on CD you have the problem
that it is ever ongoing, with new pics released and sometimes old pics replaced.
You can create a small CSV out of the current CSV and a certain base CSV representing
the state of your collection when you recorded it on CD. All portfolios that were added
or changed since go into the new CSV:

scansort -F  base_CSV

You can combine the base csv option with any other fsplit option.

Play around with the features, see what happens and decide for yourself how you want
to collect the Cyberclub collection !
