ScanSort is a utility that can be used to identify, verify
and  sort  images  based upon information contained in CSV
files. It can also generate reports about  the  status  of
image  collections  and  create archives of files to trade
with others.

I did not check all operations of the ScanSort completely, 
but all looks as if it works :)

The source codes may be compiled with IBM VisualAge 3.6.5.
