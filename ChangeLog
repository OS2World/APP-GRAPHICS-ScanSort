The beginning !

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  and target path with -m option would delete pictures.
  No more danger there now !

Help message if wrong switch entered.

-l to suppress logfile

-H and -rH to create list of all files you have
-h to import this list (for collections that span multiple volumes)

Configurable reports

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.30    08.12.97 

Added trading functions !

-dp     set target directory (instead of current)
-K	kill duplicate CSV-files

fixed bug which crashed program on some reports
switched from PKZip to InfoZip (long filenames !), removed -tb
support Draco Reports (with lots of '|' )

-tZname 	set basename for zips
-_ 		don't replace spaces in filenames by underscores (yuck)
-rS 		print summary for all collections



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.42    22.12.97

another bugfix (sigh...)
... had added a comment to the beginning of havefiles which made them invalid ...
Now havefiles are run through even if there are corrupt entries.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.50    19.01.98

Well, folks, Scansort has reached now more than 3000 lines of code. I have changed
a LOT of internal stuff in this release to optimize memory usage and I just hope
I tied up all lose ends. But if you have ever written a program, you know that
"those bugs have a way of saying 'crunch' and then running away when you lift
your foot" (Mike Gummelt, Hexen II Team, Raven Software)...

There are NO known bugs in this release, so please tell me if you find one. There
are some probably, it's impossible to check all kombinations of environments and switches.

Changes:

-C -Ce -Cc -Cce   create/update CSV files
wildcards in configfile, reports can be suppressed individually
reduced memory usage
don't reject complete CSV if some entries are with zero length 
removed quotes from descriptions
sort CSVs by name
if verbose (-v) check database for "same name in same target dir" and "same pic in several collections"
write all switches to logfile
verbose summary -rS now useful in logfile
-dbDIR  set target directory for bad files
bad files are now only copied if they are at least 40% of the original, and never overwritten 

changed format of havelist to CSV-Style, -rHs creates special format for database export

trading:
Proceed multiple reports in one run! Sync your whole collection with your friends!
-rT: create HTML tables for trade pages 
accept multiple source paths for trading, and either the actual path (as before)
  or a collection base path
-tA, -tO, -tG  create verbose named Textfiles
backup give.txt before overwriting
changed default number for giving from 5 to "all"

fixed:
  source-target-overlap check works now (cross your fingers !)
  -K works now together with -dc
  files with spaces or 'â' in the name are now always recognized (they are still a nuisance)
  close logfile on error

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.60    16.02.98

create model collections
switched to version 2.2 of InfoZip (this won't run with ScanSort 1.50)
some output goes now to the logfile only with -v (default logfile MUCH smaller)
removed dumb special characters (like â, é) from picture names (for Kâta and Renée ...)
  (these are a nuisance once you burn a CD)
remove CSV prefixes only if they are "MTCM_", "McBluna_", "SSMC_" or "Checker_"
-B    leave bad files alone

config file:
-     exclude collection from wildcard list
=     delete CSV file

reports:
added Kilobytes to summaries
removed empty collections from -rS output
added empty collections to -rT output
added summary output for complete collections
-rf   freshen (only write reports where new pictures have arrived)
always write verbose summary to logfile

trading:
-tr   choose at random, default now alphabetical
-tf, -tF make a test run without copying anything
-tm, -tM  make list of files missing in both collections   
can give a trading quantum (e.g. 10 MB) for collection matching
delete report files if everything is given or need_....txt is created

fixes:
-K : delete same-sized duplicates (the first in the config file remains)
     (like MTCM_AdmiralKrag_2138 and McBluna_AdmiralKrag_2138)
-s : works again (got broken in 1.50 and NOBODY noticed it)
Output redirection works again     
could crash with GPF when creating CSVs



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.61    05.05.98

abort after 3 failures to write pics to target path (e.g. if disk full)
don't delete small bad pictures with -m by default any more, move to BadPictures instead.
   Use -b40 to get behaviour as before (move if > 40% of original size, delete otherwise)
collection name for e.g. MTCM_GerPBpcd_(FINAL)_143.csv is now
   GerPBpcd instead of GerPBpcd_(FINAL)
treat "unknown" comments in CSVs same as missing comments
-rT   create CSV zips automatically, create everything in the reportpath
-rTv  vacation-table, no text links
-ro   output summary to "summary.txt" in the report path  
split summary table in complete and incomplete collections
warn if a CSV with more pics is smaller (probably no comments in it)
-l (suppress logfile) now allowed in config file
-R   do not recurse subdirectories when searching for pics	
added summary (nr of pics, kbytes) to trading reports (ask.txt, offer.txt)
-Cu  update those entries of a given CSV for which pics are available and the CRC is 0
support OCP_ and Foyle_ prefixes for CSVs
support reports from Solaris Piccheck for trading
   

Fixes:
 Have-files including pics without CRCs were not read correctly
 -H got broken in 1.60 when run with the collection path as target 
 don't handle bad files when creating a havelist (-H)
 Comments in config file behind entries work now - like
     MTCM_ScanMaster_1000.csv		# one of the finest
 collection name for e.g. SDC_60.csv was SDC_60 instead of SDC (CSVs without prefix)
 Trading: a have-list could be interpreted as miss-list when it was a Unix textfile
           (e.g. a textfile from Geocities)
          changed reports for wrong sized pics so they are recognized when trading 
 -db (set Path for bad pictures) failed if path already existed
 zero-length bad-files are now deleted (with -m or -b)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.62    17.05.98

handle extra files in collection: try to identify them and copy them to the correct name.
       With -m the old file is removed after succesful copy.
       With -E (new switch) all extra files are removed (after trying to identify them).
Filenames with cases different than in CSV are now renamed automatically
       (e.g. AV_lynne_austin_cov97_01.jpg to AV_Lynne_Austin_Cov97_01.jpg)
allow hierarchical target paths like Light&Magic, Light&Magic\Pictorials
-rT  use trade.tpl as template to create trade.html with inserted HTML-Tables and date
-rf  update reports when CSV is newer than existing report
-tw  trade whole collections (where your partner has no pics yet)
print pics without CRC to logfile in verbose mode (max 3 per collection)
      to track down CSV-Bugs like in MTCM_AVScans_365.csv:
        AV_Lynne_Austin_Cov97_01.jpg,114852,2BCG91E7,Lynne Austin - Cover Girls 97
log contents of created zipfiles to zip.log (appending)
added CSV date/time to reports
don't add empty comments ("?") to reports

Fixes:
don't create empty ask/offer/miss-files 
don't print 100% o.k in summary for large collections with few pics missing
don't treat opened files (e.g. with download in process) as bad 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.63    17.06.98

Support multiple collections in one directory. Without limitations.
-rHb  create a havelist "have.bin" in binary format - much smaller, much faster to import
-dwDIR  set DIR as wastebasket directory (instead of .\ScanSortWaste )
      All files are now moved to the wastebasket instead of deleting them
      (except files that were really copied to the collection)
-w    turn wastebasket feature off      
trading:
-tg   1-500:number of pics, 501-...:number of kilobytes to give (threshold was 1000 before)
improved report parser again; supports now reports with spaces in names
      or crippled extensions (Mastertech bug), support Draco v0.221 reports ("okay")

Fixes:
don't delete pics of collections sharing the same directory any more =:-(
      (happened in 1.62 with -m when reports were generated. Sorry folks ! )
don't crash when last file in alphabetical index turns up as bad :-(
don't convert new filenames to uppercase during CSV generation if they have more than 8 characters
make switch plausibility checks BEFORE reading all CSVs
-rT: replace in HTML table number of "missing" by number of "needed"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.64    20.07.98

Support for E-CSVs (entries like img0002.jpg,162772,b64456a8,\Amanda Weaver (Bonita Saint)\, )
Support collections with mixed picture types (gif and jpg) (use -a switch)
Files in BadPictures or in the waste are now renamed instead of overwritten
-rE   suppress empty reports (e.g. of completed collections)
-rR   recurse collection for report generation, like in versions before 1.61
      This is not recommended and only needed if pics were manually moved to subfolders.
-rn   add numbers of have/all to report names (like CSA_239-240.txt )
-rA   report all collections (even inactive ones)
removed (undocumented) support for comments in CSV files - now the
      SWA_1st_Anniversary_Collection (with all picnames beginning with '#') can be handled
trading: UNKNOWN / EXTRA files are treated as have now
removed CC from prefix list so that CC pictorials now keep their prefix
can create several levels of directories now
show in logfile which csvs have descriptions or are E-CSVs (a 'D'/'E' after the CRC info)
create descript.ion only if there are descriptions in the CSV (otherwise remove it)
add info about location of pics to summary (when using have files)
-T    touch pics when moving them to the collection (set date/time to current)

Fixes:
lines in trading reports could be ignored (I start hating this piece of code... :-[ )
handle CSV names like SI_044-Michelle.csv (number behind underscore INSIDE) correctly

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.641    22.07.98

Fixed a damned bug which could crash Scansort during report generation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.642    07.08.98

add info about how many kb a collection uses on your harddisk to summary.txt 
    (very useful for burning CDs !)
Fixes:
-rc would crash in 1.64 and 1.641. Damn. :-(
sometimes trading would recognize the wrong collection

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.7      16.10.98

changed format of config file: now using collection names instead of csv names (SEE DOKU !)
speedup on startup
-K will clean up ALL files in the CSV folder, not only those currently in use
-pMTCM	define MTCM_ as collection prefix
-PMTCM	define MTCM_ as collection prefix which will be removed with -K
-rr	in config file: supress report generation.
        in config file AND in command line: generate reports again.
        The idea is to keep all the report options in the config file, but do the lengthy
        report generation only on deman. However if you use -rf (freshen) and pics were
        added to a collection the report for this collection IS generated.
        If you use -rT (HTML-table) or -rH (have-list) -rr is ignored.
-Ca	create CSV for all files in the current folder (not just pics)
-hx	ignore all havelists (so you don't have to comment out every single one)
don't check all collections when trading and no report options are given (or -rr is used)
print a message when a collection was just finished (only when reports are generated)
automatically identify file extensions used in the collections (like gif, mpg, nfo).
        No more need to use -a !
renaming/moving of extra files now only with -m (except case changes)
don't count moved files as deleted any more, list deleted files in output
add screen messages when CRC-Checking collections
-Hb     create binary havelist (before only possible as -rHb, see doku)

Fixes:
-rA would not print inactive collections to summary
non-jpg files were tried to be repaired even if they were o.k.
add path in collection when reporting extra files in an E-CSV collection

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.71     26.01.99

ignore "scan"/"scans" in collection names - "Nightwing" and "Nightwing_Scans" is the same now
        ( except in the beginning, so "Scanbyte" and "Bytescans" stay different )
-rI some comment  - add some comment to every report
-rx     export all missings to missing.csv
-Kr	clean up CSVs and rename them to the collection names. This also removes all prefixes.
bad files in the collection now go to the waste when good ones appear (there could be bad pics
        complete with a bad CSV cause good pics to be overwritten)
show extensions in report if collection has different file types
ditched the Colver joke
removed source paths for screen output ("Moved xxx to yyy")
create report path(s) if necessary
add list of collections not used to log file

Fixes:
when moving bad pics to BadPictures they were renamed to random filenames sometimes :-(
inserted carriage return after summary output
don't abort reading a havelist when there are bad entries in it
NEVER report descript.ion as "extra file" (could happen before when using -a)
don't handle any bad files when scanning with -H

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.8       02.07.99

Source code released
Unix port

extras are now written to the end of a report
summary doesn't list a CD for a collection if all pics are on HD
-L	lowercase all filenames
-Le     lowercase just all extensions
convert missing.csv (-rx) to E-CSV format
summary: make extra section for inactive collections (only output with -rA),
         label sections (complete, incomplete, inactive)
support names with commas in CSV (if enclosed in "") (also in havelists and CSV generation)
-d switches now support the ~ char which stands for your home directory under unix.
   You can use this under Windows as well if you type like   set HOME=d:\scans 
   before running Scansort.
multiple CSV paths possible now
recognize a CRC of 0xAAAAAAAA as a dummy
-p / -P can be used to handle suffixes as well.
recognize something_300f.csv and something_300_final.csv correctly
-xi     make target dir for Scanmaster_Index Scanmaster\Index
                    and for ScanmasterExtras Scanmaster\Extras
-xu     print unused CSV names into logfile (this was always done before)
-xb10   ignore bad files if the length of their name (without extension) is less or equal
        than 10 characters. The idea is to use -xb8 so that Photoshoots (named img0001.jpg)
        will never be treated as bad.
trading: support simple request lists (just one filename per line, no size)
-CE     create E-CSVs
-Cr     recurse source directory for CSV creation
-Ma	create a Diashow list (AIS format) for ACDSee 2.4. Finally the model feature
          has become really useful ! :-)
-rX     export missings into CSVs (one per collection). Yeah, you've talked me into
          this. Now I just hope everybody will be able to tell the difference between
          "real" CSVs and requests on the newsgroups... :-|
-sName  single collections can now be used together with a config file. In this case,
          all the paths and switches from the config file are used, but the collections
          are ignored. Only the collections from the commandline are used.
          Great for speeding up trading.
-hcd*.bin   wildcards are now allowed for importing havelists. Warning: the order of the
            import is determined by the OS (meaning random), so I suggest you don't use
            wildcards (see doku)
removed limit of 250 for havelists  

Fixes:
pictures named only in digits (990733.jpg) now work in standard havefiles
ignore brief flag (no comments, -rb) when reporting E-CSVs
Scansort would crash NASTY on corrupt CSVs. Limited filenames to 100 chars
  and E-CSV-paths to 150 chars to prevent this.
only write inactive collections to missing.csv with -rA
don't write "HD" in the summary if there's just an empty target path
"on HD" item in summary didn't include pics sorted in in the current run
Model search didn't treat spaces and underscores as same

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.81      27.08.99  - probably final version

-rN	export missings into filter files for Forte Agent Newsreader
-dN     set directory for filter files
-rT	include missing.csv in request.zip 
missing-CSVs : append a comma on E-CSV-missings so Hunter can digest them better
-F      split Cyberclub CSVs from Gully Foyle
-hb     convert all ASCII havelists to binary
-dCpath Set a path where Scansort should move all CSVs in use to. If there are
        two -dC the first will be for incomplete, the second for complete collections.
        (If a CSV becomes UNUSED it won't be moved back however.)
Unix:   default align in makefile.gcc is 0 now (for Intel-Linux).
        Sparc users, set ALIGN to 7 or get nice Bus Errors ! 

Fixes:
Scansort could crash on CSVs named like _Ongoing_1148.csv
-h : ~ for homedirectory was not supported, no warning if a wildcard didn't match anything
trading: check if reportfiles exist before reading everything
strange characters (umlauts) are replaced again (broken in 1.8)
handle collections > 2GB correctly (no more negative kbs in summary)
Unix can handle CSVs with extension .CSV (or .Csv or whatever) now
there may have been a problem in 1.8 handling entries without CRC in text havelists
Extras in report are now sorted
